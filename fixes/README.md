This directory contains fixes that need to be applied to final zip so it flashes and works fine.

*updater-script needs manual fix so it sets permissions properly. This is because the updater script generated by default doesn't set the permissions correctly (for some reason) and you may end up having no bootanimation, no wifi, no mobile network etc due to that.

*The next fix is simply an error inside the `values` in `MiuiSystemUI` which causes torch toggle to not work. The fix is already compiled so it can be easily placed in apk during build process.

**All the fixes are applied automatically during the build process**

**PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE/MODIFY ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING**

*Read the `README` in [home][1] directory of project for build instructions.*
